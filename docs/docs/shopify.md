# Shopify

In order to allow SkyPoint access to your Shopify account, you'll need:

Shop URL
API Key
Password

To generate a API key + password combination, follow the [Private Apps](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/authenticate-a-private-app-with-shopify-admin "Shopify Private Apps") instructions on Shopify. 

In order for SkyPoint to import the Shopify customer, products, abandoned checkouts and order details the permissions read_orders and read_customers must be granted to the generated API key.
