## Entities

Click on Entities to see individual dataflow entities data and its attributes. 

An entity is a collection of attributes and metadata that defines a concept (such as Account or Contact) and can be defined by any data producer. An entity may match the schema of a standard entity, defined as part of the Common Data Model and listed in the [GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/cdmrepo). Entities that don’t match one of the standard shapes are said to be custom entities.
