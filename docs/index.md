## How Does It Work?

SkyPoint CDP is a realcdp.org complaint SaaS product. It provides following key capabilities:

- Ingest data from any source
- Capture full detail of ingested data
- Store ingested data indefinitely (subject to privacy constraints)
- Create unified profiles of identified individuals/customers/consumers/leads/prospects etc. (360 degree-view)
  - [Common Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-model/) compliant unified profiles can then be segmented and enriched to create highly flexible targets for marketing or further analysis.
- Share data with any system that needs it (E.g. personalization, seo/sem, marketing, analytics, AI/machine learning etc.)
  - Utilize [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/) to create automated workflows and no-code solutions.
