# SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP)

Customer data makes up the foundation of an organization. It tells who’s buying, what they want, and how best to reach them. But for many businesses, customer data is siloed across systems, impossible to unify, and not actionable across the organization.

We built SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP) from the ground up to solve this problem by unifying all your customer data at scale, delivering a complete customer 360 and predictive insights. 

## How Does It Work?

SkyPoint CDP is a realcdp.org complaint SaaS product. It provides following key capabilities:

- Ingest (Import) data from any source
- Capture full detail of ingested data
- Store ingested data indefinitely (subject to privacy constraints)
- Create unified (Stitch and Timelines) profiles of identified individuals/customers/consumers/leads/prospects/organizations etc. (360 degree-view)
  - [Common Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-model/) compliant unified profiles can then be segmented and enriched to create highly flexible targets for marketing or further analysis.
- Share (Export) data with any system that needs it (E.g. personalization, seo/sem, marketing, analytics, AI/machine learning etc.)
 - External integration is also supported by APIs and SkyPoint Connector for example to use [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/) to create automated workflows and no-code solutions.

## Sources (Import)

SkyPoint imports data from Sources. Imported data is transformed into Common Data Model (CDM) entities. 

## Profile (Stitch)

Profiles enables you to create unified customer profiles in SkyPoint, to build and enrich audiences, and to activate audiences across various destinations such as marketing, sales and services tools.

Identity Resolution utilizing rules and machine learning sits at the core of the stitch process. 

The SkyPoint stitch process matches and merges the complete history of each customer into a single profile, no matter where they interact with your business. Identity Resolution allows you to understand a user’s interaction across web, mobile, server, and third party partner touch-points in realtime, using an online and offline ID graph with support for cookie IDs, device IDs, emails, and custom external IDs.

## Destinations (Export)

Destinations receive (export or activate) data from SkyPoint. Any entities or a collection of entities can be exported including source entities and SkyPoint generated entities such as Profile, Timelines, Audience, Metrics etc.
